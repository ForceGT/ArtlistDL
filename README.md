# Artlist DL

A Mac OS Desktop app made to download songs form [artlist.io](https://www.artlist.io) easily without requiring a premium account.


## Technical aspects

The desktop app runs on MacOS and utilises the power of cross-platform framework Flutter and the language features of Dart

## Getting started

- Go to the Releases section, grab the `artlist_dl.app` from there, and double click it after it's downloaded. It might show a prompt 
"This app is from an untrusted developer"
 So you would ideally follow the steps below
- Whitelist the app from the `Control Center`. Go to `Security` and click `Allow files from Unidentified Developers`
- The app will now launch automatically
- You can move the `.app` file to the `Applications` Folder by dragging it via the Finder
